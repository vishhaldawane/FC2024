  who will decide that which data will go in which type of container?

		YOU

	-- all are interdependent upon each other --

	Container developer is responsible
	to provide its own iterator

  Array
		- group of variables
		- *of similar type
		- stored in consecutive memory location
		- referred by a common name

java.util package
:
  ArrayList <-- container same like array

		- but it can store data of different types
		- it CAN grow or shrink at runtime
